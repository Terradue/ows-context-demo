## OGC OWS Context demo

The [OGC Web Services Context Document](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/owc (OWS Context)) describes the use cases, requirements and conceptual model for the OWS Context encoding standard.

This standard provides a core model, which is extended and encoded as defined in extensions to this standard. A ‘context document’ specifies a fully configured service set which can be exchanged (with a consistent interpretation) among clients supporting the standard. 

The OGC Web Services Context Document was created to allow a set of configured information resources (service set) to be passed between applications primarily as a collection of services. OWS Context is developed to support in-line content as well (e.g. [Geography Markup Language (GML)](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/gml)). 

The goal is to support use cases such as the distribution of search results, the exchange of a set of resources such as OGC [Web Feature Service (WFS)](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wfs), [Web Map Service (WMS)](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wms), [Web Map Tile Service (WMTS)](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wmts), [Web Coverage Service (WCS)](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wcs) and others in a ‘common operating picture’. Additionally OWS Context can deliver a set of configured processing services ([Web Processing Service (WPS)](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wps)) parameters to allow the processing to be reproduced on different nodes.
